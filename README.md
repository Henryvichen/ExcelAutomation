# ExcelAutomation

A practice project made in Python that automates changes to transactions in an excel spreadsheet.
In this project the scenario is the prices of each transaction need to be reduced by 10%,
If there were over hundreds of transactions, this would take forever by hand.

The program creates a new row where it stores the updated price of every transaction and creates a bar graph with the updated prices.

It was very good practice for learning to use external packages and how to manipulate data in an excel spreadsheet.
